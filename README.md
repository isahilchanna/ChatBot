# How did i get the thought to make this? 
My father told me that he wants an  WhatsApp  chatbot through ai and python, though i wasn't abble to make an WhatsApp chatbot in python but i was able to make this in just 3 hours. I wasn't able to make WhatsApp ChatBot because of lack of knowledge to use that specific modules.
