 ## Working 
 The '''generate_response''' function takes the user's input, checks it against the keywords defined in the various functions, and returns an appropriate response based on the highest-priority keyword matched.
 
 ## Pros-
- The code is written in Python, a widely used and popular programming language.
* The chatbot responds to different types of inputs, such as greetings, inquiries about the user's well-being, and questions asked by the user.
+ The chatbot uses the Wikipedia API to answer user questions.
- The chatbot provides a default response when it doesn't understand the user's input.

# Theoretical Understanding- 
+ Introduction to the chatbot:

The chatbot is a program written in Python that can communicate with users by interpreting and responding to text-based inputs. The chatbot is designed to respond to certain keywords or phrases, such as greetings, inquiries about the user's well-being, and questions asked by the user. The chatbot is also capable of using the Wikipedia API to provide information and answer user questions.

By responding to user inputs in a conversational manner, the chatbot can create a more engaging and personalized experience for the user. The chatbot can also be used in a variety of settings, such as customer service, education, and entertainment, among others.

The chatbot's functionality and capabilities can be further developed and improved with additional programming and integration with other tools and technologies. Ultimately, the chatbot has the potential to be a powerful and versatile tool for interacting with users in a variety of contexts.
