+ The chatbot uses the Wikipedia API to answer user questions.
- The chatbot provides a default response when it doesn't understand the user's input.
* The code is easy to understand and modify if needed, with each function focusing on a specific keyword or phrase and returning a corresponding response.
# Cons-
